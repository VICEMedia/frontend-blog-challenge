# Frontend Developer Challenge

## Challenge

Please make a simple single page application to display blog posts.

You should fetch data for the blog posts from the [Json Placeholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), which
provides posts, comments etc. 

Display each blog post appropriately in a list which the option to click through to a single blog post which should
be displayed with its comments (if it has any).

It must be possible to return to the listing page from a single blog post.

## Suggested Approach

You are free to structure the code however you see fit. You may find it easiest to fork this repository and start from
there. 

A solution using vue.js is preferred but use whatever tools you are comfortable with. For help setting up vue see
[vuejs-templates](https://github.com/vuejs-templates).

## Submitting

Please provide a github repository. The readme should explain how to run your application.
